Semaphores
Semaphores is a more advanced locking mechanism, which has an internal counter, rather than a lock flag, and it only blocks, 
if more than a given number of threads have attempted to hold the semaphore. 
Depending on how the semaphore is initialized, this allows multiple threads to acces the same code section the same time.
